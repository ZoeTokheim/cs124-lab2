## Alternate Designs: Single List Page

## Usability Testing

any user testing you did

## Usability Testing: Home Page

<img src="user_test_home_page_plus.png" alt="User Testing Home Page Plus Icon Only" width="200px">

Users understood that the plus icon was for creating a new list; no need for text explaining the plus icon

## Usability Testing: Home Page New Version

<img src="user_test_home_page_new_version.png" alt="User Testing Home Page New Version" width="200px">

Users didn't think the "Create New List" text was necessary; they understood it from the plus icon before.

They understood that if you tap an individual list, you should see more of the list (i.e., tasks contained in the list).

They understood the swiping thing would reveal the edit and trash icons. Mentioned other apps use swiping.

They understood the pencil icon would bring them to a page to edit the list.

They understood the trash icon would delete the list.

## Usability Testing: Home Page Search

<img src="user_test_home_page_search.png" alt="User Testing Home Page Search" width="200px">

Users want to see all the list items before searching so it's like the search filters.

## Usability Testing: Single List Page

<img src="user_test_single_list_page.png" alt="User Testing Single List Page" width="200px">

Users knew what the home icon meant, but preferred a back icon more reflective of the arrow icon that took them from the Home Page to this Single List Page.

Users didn't like that the Add New Task and Delete Tasks buttons were right next to each other -> easy to make a mistake.

## Usability Testing: Edit Task Page

<img src="user_test_edit_task_page.png" alt="User Testing Edit Task Page" width="200px">

Users didn't see a way to get out of this page without deleting the task they were trying to edit. So we decided to add an X icon and a checkmark to do BLANK to get back to the Single List Page
