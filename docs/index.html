        <h3>Before:</h3>
        <div class="walkthrough-iframe-and-text">
          <iframe

          ></iframe>
          <p class="walkthrough-text">
            This is what an empty list looks like in our app. To create an item,
            the user can click on the plus icon in the bottom right corner of
            the screen. This will pull up a page to create a new list, shown
            below.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that if you click on the plus icon, the button will change
            color and compress slightly, indicating that it has been activated.
          </p>

          ></iframe>
          <p class="walkthrough-text">
            Next, the user is brought to a page to create a new list item. They
            will be able to change the name of the task (for instance, they can
            name it "Buy new John Grisham book"), the due date, and the
            location. They can also add any relevant notes. If the user decides
            they don't want to create the task, they can press the X in the top
            left corner, which cancels the task creation. When the user is done
            creating a task, they can press the check in the upper right corner
            to save the task to the list.
            <br />
            <br />
            The X and check buttons respond to being pressed by changing size
            and color. Currently, only the name field is editable on this page.
            We plan to implement the rest of this form when we transfer our app
            over to JavaScript / React.

            by default, left unchecked.
