    <div class="required-components">
      <h2>Add Item to Empty List</h2>
      <b>For instance, in an empty list, create an item named "Buy new John Grisham book"</b>
      <h3>Before:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360px" height="100%" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        This is what an empty list looks like in our app. To create an item, the user can click on the plus
        icon in the bottom right of the screen. This will pull up a page to create a new list, shown below.
        <br/> <br/>
        Note that if you click on the plus icon, the button will change color and compress slightly, indicating 
        that it has been activated.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>During:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        Next, the user is brought to a page to create a new list item. They will be able to change the name of the task 
        (for instance, they can name it "Buy new John Grisham book"), the due date, the location, and add any relevant notes.
        If the user decides they don't want to create the task, they can press the X in the top left corner, which cancels the 
        task creation. When the user is done creating a task, they can press the check in the upper rght corner. 
        <br/> <br/>
        The X and check buttons respond to being pressed by changing size and color. Currently, only the name field is editable 
        on this page. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>After:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        When the user presses the checkbox, confirming the creation of the new task, they are brought back to the list page, where
        the task and its due date are visible. Note that the completed box is, by default, unchecked.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    
    <div class="required-components">
      <h2>Add Item to Non-Empty List</h2>
      <b>For instance, in a non-empty list, create an item named "Eat Lunch"</b>
      <h3>Before:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        Notice that our list is not currently empty. To create an additional item in this list, the user can press the plus icon in the 
        bottom right of the screen. Notice that this is the same as creating an additional item in an empty list. As before, when the user clicks 
        this icon, they will be brought to a page to create a new task.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="required-components">
      <h2>Add Task to Empty List</h2>
      <b>For instance, in an empty list, create an item named "Buy new John Grisham book"</b>
      <h3>During:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        As before, the user can create the task in this screen. All features are the same as they were when the user added a task 
        to an empty list.
