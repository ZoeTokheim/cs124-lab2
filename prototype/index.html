      <h2>Add Item to Empty List</h2>
      <b>For instance, in an empty list, create an item named "Buy new John Grisham book"</b>
      <h3>Before:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        This is what an empty list looks like in our app. To create an item, the user can click on the plus
        icon in the bottom right of the screen. This will pull up a page to create a new list, shown below.
        <br/> <br/>
        Note that if you click on the plus icon, the button will change color and compress slightly, indicating 
        that it has been activated.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>During:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_in_progress.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        Next, the user is brought to a page to create a new list item. They will be able to change the name of the task 
        (for instance, they can name it "Buy new John Grisham book"), the due date, the location, and add any relevant notes.
        If the user decides they don't want to create the task, they can press the X in the top left corner, which cancels the 
        task creation. When the user is done creating a task, they can press the check in the upper rght corner. 
        <br/> <br/>
        The X and check buttons respond to being pressed by changing size and color. Currently, only the name field is editable 
        on this page. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>After:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_empty_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        When the user presses the checkbox, confirming the creation of the new task, they are brought back to the list page, where
        the task and its due date are visible. Note that the completed box is, by default, unchecked.
        </p>
      </div>



      <h2>Add Item to Non-Empty List</h2>
      <b>For instance, in a non-empty list, create an item named "Eat Lunch"</b>
      <h3>Before:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_non_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        Notice that our list is not currently empty. To create an additional item in this list, the user can press the plus icon in the 
        bottom right of the screen. This is the same button the user would use to create an item in an empty list. As before, when the user clicks 
        this icon, they will be brought to a page to create a new task.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>During:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_non_empty_in_progress.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        The user is brought to the same screen that we saw earlier. To cancel the creation of this new task, the user can press the X button. To confirm 
        the creation of the task, they can press the check. They can edit fields like date, time, location, etc.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>After:</h3>
      <div>
        <iframe src="list_non_empty_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
        <p>
        The list item the user created has been added to the list.
        </p>
      </div>



    <h2>Mark List Item Completed</h2>
    <b>For instance, mark the item named "Call Mom" completed (assumes there exists an item named "Call Mom").
    </b>
    <h3>Before:</h3>
    <div>
      <iframe src="list_call_mom_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
      <p>
      As before, the user can create the task in this screen. All features are the same as they were when the user added a task 
      to an empty list. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>During:</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      To mark an item completed, the user can simply tap the checkbox next to the item 
      they want to mark completed. There is no intermediate screen. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>After:</h3>
    <div>
      <iframe src="list_call_mom_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
      <p>
      After the user taps the checkbox, the list item is marked completed (indicated by the filled-in checkbox).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Add Item to Non-Empty List</h2>

    <h3>Before:</h3>
    <div>
      <iframe src="list_non_empty_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
      <p>
      Notice that our list is not currently empty. To create an additional item in this list, the user can press the plus icon in the

      </p>
    </div>

      The list item the user created has been added to the list.
      </p>
    </div>



  <h2>Rename/Edit List Items</h2>
  <b>For instance, rename the item "Text John" to "Text John about bank statements" (assumes there exists an item named "Text John").
  </b>
  <h3>Before:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_call_mom_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    From the list page, the user can press on the pencil icon next to their list item. This takes them to 
    a page to edit their list item.
    </p>
    <iframe src="edit_task_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
  </div>
  <h3>During:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="edit_task_in_progress.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    From this edit page, the user can click on the task name and rename it to their desired new name.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>After:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="edit_task_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    Afterwards, the user can press the checkmark, and the name of their list item will have changed on the main list page.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Show only uncompleted items.</h2>
  <h3>Before:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_hide_completed_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    Before, we can see that completed items still appear on the list page. To hide list items, the user first presses the three dots in the top right corner.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>During:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_hide_completed_in_progress.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    A menu appears with options to edit the list and change which items are shown. To show only uncompleted items, the user can press the button 
    that says "Hide Completed Tasks."
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>After:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_hide_completed_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    Now, only uncompleted tasks are shown.
    </p>
  </div>


  <h2>Delete all completed items.</h2>
  <h3>Before:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_delete_completed_initial.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    This process is similar to hiding completed items. However, in this process, you will not be able to bring back completed items after you 
    delete them. Before deleting completed items, we can see that completed items still appear on the list page. To delete these completed items, 
    the user will presses the three dots in the top right corner. This will bring up the menu we saw earlier.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>During:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_delete_completed_in_progress.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    A menu appears with options to edit the list and change which items are shown. To delete completed items, the user can press the button 
    that says "Delete completed tasks."
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>After:</h3>
  <div>
    <iframe src="list_delete_completed_after.html" width="360" height="640" style="border:1px solid black;" class = "walkthrough_frame"></iframe>
    <p>
    Now, only uncompleted tasks remain.
    </p>
  </div>
